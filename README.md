“a priority queue”
Gnu copyleft: Charles J. Short


Confusion, misinformation, and prioritization problems are the subject of work and struggle everyday for human beings. Clear information which correctly prioritizes the commodity of time and attention has high value. For example, the 7 digit phone number is designed to match the normal human IQ. 

1. It is scientifically evident that many human beings have cognitive thresholds, quantifiable cognitive thresholds.  Specifically a numerical threshold of 127 which is 2^7 – 1 the size of a priority queue. 

2. A socialist society will operate within the cognitive threshold of 127 for a percentage of observed communication events with PID feedback control for achieving a set point. Proportional, integral, and derivative factors interact to produce an estimated ideal hierarchy which changes through feedback.

3. ‘proportional’, reward metric of scarce rating: A rating system of 1 to 7 wherein a socialite may give 1 vote to 64 people, 2 votes to 32 people, 3 votes  to 16 people, 4 votes to 8 people, 5 votes  to 4 people, 6 votes  to 2 people, and 7 votes  to 1 person because that’s the best ‘out degree’ which can be expected of most people: 127 links to other people is a limit on your capacity to honor other people. 

4. ‘integral’, reward metric of scarce currency: currency is not limited by block chain cryptography currency; therefore proportional tree simply augments capitalism.

5. ‘differential’ correction metric. The Socialist127 differential metric is the application of priority d-queuing and new queuing with timestamps at each level; reflecting red down step, green for up steps.

6. personal priority queue data -> community priority queue data, loop.

7. A socialist society will provide an open feedback loop to effectuate PID economic government; so people can restructure the binary tree hierarchy according to any error with respect to their set point.

Some people will have an higher in-degree than out-degree. The person with the highest in-degree will be at the root of the tree. Achieving a higher in-degree is a competitive process like any. People will compete to achieve an higher in-degree by providing pay, goods and services of higher quality. Services may be personal or political.
 
Most people rationally include an estimated people of normal variance in cognitive capacity in government office but exclude abnormally mentally diminished people from executing government office.

In capitalist society ownership of media companies means you have the power to regulate the conversation. In a socialist society you as a 3rd party have equal say in how the conversation is regulated.

Any transaction is subject to a rating in a world of perfect coverage. But in practicality only a proportion of transactions would be rated. Your highest priority interrupt would receive a 7 rating. A single scan, “restaurant menu” bar code, is a one-click app solution by which you can prioritize your queue.

The next size of binary tree is too confusing:

Note: increasing confusion towards bottom.


The first page of this manifesto is of higher importance than second page. 




In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

Client software extracts Collection Socialist127 { root: 0 }  list of 127 player/citizens “playzen” with style modification for branch and leaf node of binary tree including highest rated playzen at root 0.

Client software includes rating input means connected to Server

Server software accept priority queue rating means and stores new ratings in database A

Worker software reads database A rating data and produces binary tree priority queue
wherein said highest rated person has highest priority.

Worker software writes binary tree priority queue data in database B

Server software reads Socialist127 priority queue data from database B

Client software presents renewed Socialist127 playzen Collection with style modifications for branch and leaf node of renewed tree.
